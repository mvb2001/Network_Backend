This repository contains the backend implementation of the Multiplayer Quiz Game, developed using pure Java, JavaFX, and MongoDB. The backend is responsible for managing player connections, question delivery, timers, auto-submission of unanswered questions, and score tracking. It uses Java SocketServer for real-time communication with multiple clients, multithreading to handle concurrent players, and synchronized data structures to ensure thread-safe operations. The backend also provides integration points for MongoDB question management and REST API endpoints for retrieving the leaderboard and player data.
